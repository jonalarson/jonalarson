### 👨‍💻 DevOps Engineer | Cloud Whisperer | Coffee Enthusiast ☕

I automate everything except my laundry. Here to make sure your code runs smoother than my attempts at adulting.

🔧 Skills:
- Turning coffee into code
- Making servers sing (or at least hum)
- YAML wrangling wizardry

🌩️ Clouds: I’ve got my head in the clouds, but my feet are firmly planted on the ground… mostly.

🐶 Fun Fact: My dog is my biggest fan and my toughest code reviewer.

Let’s build something awesome—just don’t forget to document it! 🚀
