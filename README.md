### 👨‍💻 DevOps Engineer | Cloud Whisperer | Coffee Enthusiast ☕

I automate everything except my laundry. Here to make sure your code runs smoother than my attempts at humor.

🔧 Skills:
- Turning coffee into code -- CloudFormation / Terraform / Ansible
- Making servers sing (or at least hum) -- AWS / Kubernetes
- Debugging: Being the detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer -- Bash / Python
- YAML wrangling wizardry -- GitHub Actions / Jenkins / ArgoCD

🌩️ Clouds: I’ve got my head in the clouds, but my feet are firmly planted on the ground… mostly.

🐶 Fun Fact: My dog is my biggest fan and my toughest code reviewer.

Let’s build something awesome—just don’t forget to document it! 🚀

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Python, IaC, CI/CD pipelines, or Container projects
